## Usage

Say you have a TOML file that looks like this:

```toml
[postgres]
user = "pelletier"
password = "mypassword"
```

Read the username and password like this:

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/pelletier/go-toml"
)

config, err := toml.LoadFile("config.toml")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error ", err.Error())
}
configTree := config.Get("postgres").(*toml.TomlTree)
user := configTree.Get("user").(string)
password := configTree.Get("password").(string)
fmt.Println("User is ", user, ". Password is ", password)
```
